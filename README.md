 # sequelizedBurger
[Burger](https://stormy-mountain-12270.herokuapp.com/) is a data-persistient, full stack application utilizing an MVC architecture and CRUD functionalities. Internal representations of the application's data are handled using sequelize models and the handlebars view engine is used to present that information to the user. 

## CRUD 

Burger performs three out of the four basic functions of persistient storage. 

*  Reads data from a mySQL database and renders it on screen. 

*  Creates data when users 'make their own burger' in the text input box. 

*  Updates data by changing the item's 'devoured' status from true to false. 

## Technologies Used

* [Express-Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
* [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)

## Dirctions for future development
